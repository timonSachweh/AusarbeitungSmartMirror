	Abstract = {Summary form only given. This a commonly headache issue in our life, that is before dinners, meetings, movies, visits, or even only a walk, we all hesitate or finally annoyed on question "What am I gonna wear today?" Imaging such a scenario, a fashionable lady is called to meet her boyfriend when she is working in the office. Right after, she is going back home to well prepare for the date. After several tryons and comparisons, she picks a simple but elegant shirt. She is standing in front of a full-length mirror, and trying clothes one by one for hours. Meanwhile, her boyfriend is urging her to come over. But still, there are no trousers to match it. Finally, both of them may get a bad mood or even worth, they quarrel with each other for not coming on time. This is a common problem for almost everyone, especially for lady, that they have serious difficulties to make decision on which clothes to wear, or match their clothes, every time, every day. But now, a gospel, named the Smart Dressing Mirror, designed by the Lab of Intelligent Computing at Beijing Institute of Technology, China, appears for you, with some of fantastic functionalities that you need. This is also what we introduced today, a future ideas of your life in the new era of mart. Generally, this Smart Dressing Mirror is nearly the same as the traditional full-length mirror in every home in appearance, and the only difference is that the smart dressing mirror has some smart functions, which can interactive with you or be friend with you. Given that all your clothes are digitalized firstly after you bought it, and the digitalized image can be captured from the homepage of the clothes shop or pictured and normalized by the camera hidden in the top of the smart mirror. After that, with simple gestures, you can interactive with the smart mirror, and picking those digitalized clothes as you wish. You can see whether it fits or not. Furthermore, with its equipped machine learning and computer vision technolo- ies, the Smart Mirror will recommend you a bunch of fashionable and suitable upper/lower clothes for you. For example: 1) when you choose an upper/lower clothes, the system will recommend you a bunch of matched lower/upper ones, 2) when you tell the mirror which scenario you will go for, it will also suggest you a series of clothes. At the same time, clothes from e-Shopping stores will also be recommended. You can buy it immediately, and it will be delivered to you as soon as possible. This is what we offer, a fantastic smart dressing mirror, to replace the traditional mirror in every home, in the near future.},

	Abstract = {An intelligent home, what could that be? More and more
                      electronic appliances enter our private homes. Their
                      presence seems to become ubiquitous. But we usually do not
                      associate intelligence when we install new electronic
                      appliances in our home environment. When will we start to
                      call a setup of such appliances intelligent? Probably if
                      this setup simplifies tasks at hand in our daily lifes or
                      increases security or comfort of living. Setups of such
                      intelligent home environments in different places all over
                      this world have given us a clue of some useful setups and
                      some useful services which could be provided by these. Such
                      homes are usually called smart homes or eHomes. This work
                      introduces a software engineering approach to support the
                      installation of such setups for regular home owners. Its key
                      contribution is the dissolution of the software development
                      process in favor of a partly automated configuration
                      process. There are various fields where the services
                      provided in such eHome environments could support our daily
                      life: One would be the enhancement of your comfort. This
                      could be a central remote control, personal information
                      management, or even an advanced wakeup service. Another
                      need, which could be satisfied by such a service is
                      security. In this field video surveillance or interactive
                      alarm systems are possible. In the field of communication
                      email, voice-over-ip, or instant messaging services are
                      already widely used. There is a great potential for services
                      in the health sector. Telemedicine or instant medical advise
                      based on up-to-date sensor data are just some examples.
                      Furthermore, infotainment services, like video on demand,
                      teaching, or advanced multimedia experiences are of great
                      interest. Via the monitoring facilities of energy consuming
                      devices, automatic optimizations or exact billing is
                      possible. Of course these areas are not very clearly
                      separated from each other. A security service can also
                      integrate services from other fields, especially using
                      communication or even infotainment abilities. Services
                      integrating different fields will be the most interesting
                      services for potential customers of eHome systems. As the
                      prices of lots of appliances used in the previously
                      discussed services have decreased to affordable amounts. The
                      appliances are affordable for regular home-owners. Hence,
                      from this point of view the hardware for the realization of
                      smart home environments is already available at reasonable
                      costs. The question arising is: Why are eHomes not more
                      conventional? If you have a closer look at all these setups
                      you will discover that these implementations are either
                      research or hobby projects. One of the main barriers
                      blocking a broader spreading of eHomes systems is the price
                      of such systems. Even if appliances are affordable, the
                      software driving an eHome is rather expensive as it is
                      mostly developed or adapted for every single eHome. A
                      complete software development process per case is not
                      affordable for everyone. As software engineers, we are
                      particularly interested in simplifying the software
                      development process, arising when implementing a service for
                      a specific home environment. The vision is: If the software
                      for eHomes could be reused, and its adaptation and
                      configuration be automated, one of the price barriers on
                      home automation mass-market would be broken. The key point
                      of this work is the dissolution of the software development
                      process for eHome systems.},
