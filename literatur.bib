	Abstract = {An intelligent home, what could that be? More and more
                      electronic appliances enter our private homes. Their
                      presence seems to become ubiquitous. But we usually do not
                      associate intelligence when we install new electronic
                      appliances in our home environment. When will we start to
                      call a setup of such appliances intelligent? Probably if
                      this setup simplifies tasks at hand in our daily lifes or
                      increases security or comfort of living. Setups of such
                      intelligent home environments in different places all over
                      this world have given us a clue of some useful setups and
                      some useful services which could be provided by these. Such
                      homes are usually called smart homes or eHomes. This work
                      introduces a software engineering approach to support the
                      installation of such setups for regular home owners. Its key
                      contribution is the dissolution of the software development
                      process in favor of a partly automated configuration
                      process. There are various fields where the services
                      provided in such eHome environments could support our daily
                      life: One would be the enhancement of your comfort. This
                      could be a central remote control, personal information
                      management, or even an advanced wakeup service. Another
                      need, which could be satisfied by such a service is
                      security. In this field video surveillance or interactive
                      alarm systems are possible. In the field of communication
                      email, voice-over-ip, or instant messaging services are
                      already widely used. There is a great potential for services
                      in the health sector. Telemedicine or instant medical advise
                      based on up-to-date sensor data are just some examples.
                      Furthermore, infotainment services, like video on demand,
                      teaching, or advanced multimedia experiences are of great
                      interest. Via the monitoring facilities of energy consuming
                      devices, automatic optimizations or exact billing is
                      possible. Of course these areas are not very clearly
                      separated from each other. A security service can also
                      integrate services from other fields, especially using
                      communication or even infotainment abilities. Services
                      integrating different fields will be the most interesting
                      services for potential customers of eHome systems. As the
                      prices of lots of appliances used in the previously
                      discussed services have decreased to affordable amounts. The
                      appliances are affordable for regular home-owners. Hence,
                      from this point of view the hardware for the realization of
                      smart home environments is already available at reasonable
                      costs. The question arising is: Why are eHomes not more
                      conventional? If you have a closer look at all these setups
                      you will discover that these implementations are either
                      research or hobby projects. One of the main barriers
                      blocking a broader spreading of eHomes systems is the price
                      of such systems. Even if appliances are affordable, the
                      software driving an eHome is rather expensive as it is
                      mostly developed or adapted for every single eHome. A
                      complete software development process per case is not
                      affordable for everyone. As software engineers, we are
                      particularly interested in simplifying the software
                      development process, arising when implementing a service for
                      a specific home environment. The vision is: If the software
                      for eHomes could be reused, and its adaptation and
                      configuration be automated, one of the price barriers on
                      home automation mass-market would be broken. The key point
                      of this work is the dissolution of the software development
                      process for eHome systems.},
